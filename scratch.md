### Competition & Events
#### NPGC3
I participated in a game competition, namely, *NPGC3* or the National Primary Game Creation Competition.
The theme of the competition was *A Sustainable Environment*, so my groupmates and I created a `scratch` project, called "Sustainable Environment".

**Objective of Game**
For the first level, the player first has to wear a swimsuit and dive down into the ocean. There, the player has to collect trash (e.g. carboard boxes, trash bags) found in the ocean to clear it. Each time they collect trash, they get points. However, when the player fails to collect trash and the trash reaches the sea bed, points will be deducted. In addition, if the player accidently "collects" or hurts a fish, a life will be lost.

After the player has scored 50 points, the next level starts. For the second level, the player has to clean up an oil spill. The player will be given a special tool/machine to help clear the oil, called the *skimmer*. The player then drags the skimmer accross the screen to clean up the oil. If the player fails to clean up the oil in time, they will lose.
